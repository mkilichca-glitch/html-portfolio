<h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Why web-development?</h2>
    <p>The world is sprinting to a digital world. There is structure and order to coding, which I throughly enjoy. Not only that, it taps into my problem-solving and creative side too!</p>

  <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cleaning.</li>
      <li>Hiking.</li>
      <li>Spending time with loved ones.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How would I describe my personality?</h2>
    <p>Mostly introverted, but somtimes outgoing (and a bit awkward). Friendly, with a strong appreciation for meaningful communication. I believe in a clean space and a clear mind... moslty because chaos annoys me.</p>

    <h2>What is my work etiquette?</h2>
    <p>In a perfect world I would prefer to come to work and only focus on the tasks at hand for the day. I work with structure, consistency, and a deadline-driven work ethic. I believe to be approachable and cooperative, while keeping my work and personal life appropriately seperate. </p>
